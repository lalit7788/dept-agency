# dept-agency
A brand new website for DEPTÂ®, under construction.

Before proceeding further with the steps below, make sure you have npm and git installed. If you are using macOS then git will most likely already have been installed.
1. [Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Follow these steps to get the application running on your computer:
1. Open Terminal or Powershell on your computer
2. Clone the repository using the command
	`git clone git@github.com:lalit7788/dept-agency.git`
3. Once cloned, go to the root folder and install all dependencies
	`cd dept-agency`
	`npm install`
4. Once everything has been installed, run this command:
	`npm start`
5. If everything has gone well up to this point, you will either see the application getting launched automatically in your browser, or you can launch it yourself by going to `localhost:3000`. (Why 3000? Go watch Avengers: Endgame to know ;-) )

The browser of choice is Google Chrome. On Chrome you can go to Developer Tools and click on the little mobile-tablet icon at the top to launch the application in a responsive layout where you can increase or decrease the resolution to see how the application responds.

Enjoy!
